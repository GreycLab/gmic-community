# In a nutshell
#---------------

 G'MIC is a full-featured open-source framework for image processing, distributed
 under the CeCILL free software licenses (LGPL-like and/or GPL-compatible). It
 provides several user interfaces to convert / manipulate / filter / visualize
 generic image datasets, ranging from 1D scalar signals to 3D+t sequences of
 multi-spectral volumetric images, hence including 2D color images.

 G'MIC user interfaces are:

 1 - 'gmic', a command-line tool to use the G'MIC image processing features from
     a shell. In this setting, G'MIC may be seen as a friendly companion to the
     ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick software suites.

 2 - 'libgmic', a small, portable, thread-safe and multi-threaded, C++ image
     processing library to be linked to third-party applications. Its simple API
     allows programmers to add all G'MIC features in their own software without
     much efforts (a C API is available as well).
[
 3 - 'G'MIC-Qt', a plug-in to bring G'MIC capabilities to the image retouching and
     painting software GIMP, Krita and Paint.NET. More than 500 filters are already
     available, sorted by category (Artistic, Black & white, Colors, Contours,
     Deformations, Degradations, Details, Film emulation, Frames, Layers,
     Light & shadows, Patterns, Rendering, Repair, Sequences, etc.).

 4 - G'MIC Online, a web service to allow users applying image processing algorithms
     on their images, directly from a web browser.

 5 - 'ZArt', a Qt-based interface for real-time processing of video streaming coming
     from webcams or video files.

 G'MIC is an open framework: the default script language can be extended with
 custom G'MIC-written commands, defining thus new image available filters or
 effects. By the way, it already contains a substantial set of pre-defined image
 processing algorithms and pipelines (more than 1000).

 G'MIC has been designed with portability in mind, and runs on different
 platforms (Windows, Unix, MacOSX).
 Since 2008, it has been developed in the Image Team of the
 GREYC laboratory, in Caen/France, by permanent researchers working in the field
 of image processing on a daily basis.
